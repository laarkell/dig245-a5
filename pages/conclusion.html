        <p class="tasks">
          If you've gotten here then you have completed all 3 tasks! Each messy website you were brought to broke more and more basic web design rules. A few aspects of web design that the messy websites do NOT follow:
          <ul>
            <li>Margins and padding</li>
            <li>Simple color schemes</li>
            <li>Whitespace</li>
            <li>Consistency</li>
          </ul>
          Without these important aspects, the messy website is harder to navigate and it is harder to find what youre looking for.
          If you are trying to make a site usable, follow helpful guidelines on web design available all across the web. Here are a few articles to get you started.
