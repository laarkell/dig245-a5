# A5: Responsive Design in Bootstrap

The goal with this assignment is to gain practice in an area you see yourself working like design, markup, programming, on a real site. Choose one option:

1. Work with a partner to redesign and code a desktop and mobile version of the [Davidson College home page](https://www.davidson.edu/)
1. Work on your own to design and code the mobile version of the current (or a [previous](designs/)) SID project home page


## Instructions

- [ ] Setup
	- [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.
- [ ] Design (where applicable)
  - [ ] Open `designs/1.psd` in Gimp or Photoshop
  - [ ] Your layout should fit within the Bootstrap grid layout.
  - [ ] Make new versions as needed, naming them `2.psd`, `3.psd`, etc.
- [ ] HTML/CSS
  - [ ] Code your design inside `index.html`
  - [ ] Use images and text from the organization's website.
  - [ ] Use the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/) as well as custom CSS to create your design
  - [ ] Save your work and commit and push changes regularly
- [ ] Javascript
	- [ ] The coded page should contain >=2 form inputs and a submit button (e.g. an email signup, or survey).
	- [ ] You aren't required to "wire up" this form to a real database; just collect the form data and use `console.log()` to confirm the form and Javascript work.
- [ ] Publish
	- [ ] Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Note: Only *your* CSS files because Bootstrap's built-in support for older browsers [will not validate](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/))
	- [ ] When finished, [publish and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit#bookmark=id.8jryplv1i8a)
	- [ ] Refer to this [rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daQKCtPQCRhu2RhqHZbqBKVeJP7OcyCypLadfn14zBA/edit) for grading.
